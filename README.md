# diy-gui-notepad
This is a Notepad recreation with few more basic features (especially useful for coders) like a dark mode.


Its a simple GUI app made using python tkinter. To use it permanently, just edit the script if you like and open Command Prompt on the directory you have saved the files. Use pyinstaller to create a basic executable and make it the defualt .txt files viewer for your OS.
